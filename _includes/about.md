<div class="about">
<p>I am a Memoirist who writes about the intangible spaces between my Latino heritage and my American life.</P>


<P>My memoir recounts how growing uprooted between the Dominican Republic
and Texas created detachment and fragmentation that allowed me to
exist in the magic and brutality of my worlds, including the ones I
created for myself.</P>


<P>I write memoir because of its shape-shifting quality and its symbiotic
relationship to memory, especially now in the digital age.  As an
educator I see writing as a fundamental tool for validation and
self-expression or authenticity without allegiance to specific and
established literary canons.</P>
